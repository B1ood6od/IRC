<h2>Spam</h2>
<p>Spam bot is an extremely basic bot that simply talks to itself. It listens for a message (that doesnt even look like a command ;)) and proceeds to send that message back. Which, if you have two bots running on the same channel, will cause them to speak to eachother and trigger the command again.</p>
<p>Basic, ugly, works.</p>
