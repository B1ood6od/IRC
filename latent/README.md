<h2>Blood Bot</h2>
<p>Blood Bot is a child of mine whom I take with me into specific IRC chats. Inside the code are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Latent Commands; commands which reply to key words such as "hey" or "hello"</li>
  <li>User Commands; commands that listed for a user to speak, then does some fancy fancy math to decide if it wants to reply or not</li>
</ul>
