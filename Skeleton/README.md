<h2>Skeleton</h2>
<p>Skeleton is just as it's name suggests: a skeleton bot. This is <i>slightly</i> more advanced than the base these are created from, with the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comes with a <code>!ping</code> command</li>
  <li>Fun loopy thingy for dynamic nick, host, channel, password, and port</li>
  <li>Some comments to make things easier</li>
</ul>
